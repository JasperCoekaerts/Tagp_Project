# Tagp_Project
Erlang project using erlang ale and RPI.

How to do the set up, with some searching to find the how to for your system: 
- Install raspbian stretch lite OS from raspberrypi.org/Downloads
- Enable ssh by adding an empty file "ssh" without extension ( no .txt or other)
- Configure local lan to accept headless direct ethernet connection to the RPi and share the wireless internet connection with the RPi
- Install erlang OTP: find your own tutorial or follow "https://hostpresto.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-erlang-on-ubuntu-16-04/" 
- Install erlang ale: follow the steps described on https://github.com/esl/erlang_ale

Make a simple electric circuit to see if ale works.
